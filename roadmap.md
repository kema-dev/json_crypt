* Change variable names to be more descriptive
* Crypt even keys
* Add cli options for debug, short circuiting
* Detect input file encoding

* Make a GUI (? with tkinter)
* Use haveibeenpwnd.com to check if a password has been pwned
* Test on different platforms (.replace('\\', '/') for windows might be broken)
