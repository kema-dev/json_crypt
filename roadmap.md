# roadmap

* Maybe read / write in steps instead of one big I/O operation
* Make an api that can be used by other programs, and create a documentation for it
* Detect input file encoding / make an option to specify it for input and output files
* Make it usable on different type of files (csv, password manager export, ...)
* Test on different platforms (.replace('\\', '/') for windows might be broken)
* Use haveibeenpwnd.com to check if a password has been pwned
